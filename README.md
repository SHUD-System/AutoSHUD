# AutoSHUD --- Automatic and Reproducable hydrological model deployment



## Data

Mandatory data from users:

1. DEM
2. Boundary --- watershed boundary or manucipal boundary
3. Steam network
4. Projection parameters used for the spatial data. 

#### Global data

1. Elevation-ASTER GDEM v2.1
2. Soil - ISRIC SoilGrid
3. Landuse - USGS LCI, HUH (Harmonised Global Landuse for Years)
4. Forcing data - GLDAS, FLDAS, NLDAS
5. Hydrology - HydroSheds, GRWL

## Steps

1. Data preparation for the research area.
2. Pre-processing of spatial and time-series data.
3. Domain decomposition and model building.
4. Execution of the hydrologic model
5. Post-processing, calibration, analysis and visualizing.
